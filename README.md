## Introduciton
Automobiles are an essential aspect of everyday life. They make it possible to get from point A to point B on time. Automobiles are a luxury though because of the price it is not a luxury that everyone can enjoy. Many different aspects have led to the increase in the price of automobiles over the years. At the beginning of the decade, average car prices increased less than 3 percent annually until COVID-19 happened in which prices rose by 5 percent. The reason for this increase was the chip shortage that was experienced due to COVID-19. Modern cars are much more technologically advanced than previous generations of vehicles. This means that for all of that entertainment, safety, and performance tech you want in your automobile, youâ€™re going to need quite a few car chips. This price increase has led to people not being able to buy cars at an affordable. The average car price did begin to dip slightly in 2022 after COVID-19 was coming to an end. With all of this in mind, trying to predict the price of cars can be accomplished by using machine learning.
<br/>
  In this project, using the Car Prices Dataset, machine learning algorithms were trained to predict the potential prices of used automobiles. The algorithms that are going to be featured will include linear regression, random forest regressor, decision tree regressor, and support vector regression (SVR) to find the most fitting model for the predictive analysis.

## Goals of Research
This project focuses on using different machine-learning models to find the most effective way to predict used car prices. By using data provided by the online dataset, the project hopes to create an effective and efficient way of predicting used car prices depending on many different factors.

- **Primary Goal**: Develop different machine-learning models to find the model that can predict most accurately automobile prices based on many different factors.
- **Secondary Goal**: Use visualizations to identify the most important factors that lead to the pricing of used cars.
- **Predicted Outcome**: Creation of an effective and efficient machine learning model that will predict car prices.
